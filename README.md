# Simple memory game Idea --> https://dkmgames.com/Memory/pairsrun.php

- It create a grid of n by n
- it assign a number randomaly to each grid box. (game has 2 grids with same values)
- You can click upto 2 tiles/grids and if the grids values matches then it stays permannent flipped.
- if both grids don't have same value then both goes back to hidden state. (Note: the value of that grid will remain same and you need to remember it so that if you find other grid with same value then you can make them permanent.)
- Continue playing until you make all grids permanent.

# Todos:

1. Add animations to grid flips.
2. Add timer for game. (to know how much time it takes you to complete the game.)
3. Add UI to add dynamic grid size. (Ask user to add grid size 6*6 or 5*5 etc..)
